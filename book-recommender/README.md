### Book App Assignment

This book recommender app was created using the following react hooks:

- useEffect was used to create a side effect.
- useReducer was used to manage multiple states, such as genre, mood, and AI responses.
- useCallback was used to remember the function to avoid rerendering/repetitions.
- Used Gemini API for getting AI responses.

This book app allows users to select options from dropdown menus based on their preferred genre, mood, and reading level, and also ask AI to make personalized book recommendations.
