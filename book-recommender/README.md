## Book App Assignment

This book recommender app was created using the following react hooks:

- useEffect was used to create a side effect.
- useReducer was used to manage multiple states, such as genre, mood and AI responses.
- useCallback was used to remember the function to avoid rerendering/repetitions.
- used gemini api for getting the AI responses.

This book app allow users to select a list of options from the drop down menu based on their preferred genre, mood, level and also ask AI to make recommendations.
